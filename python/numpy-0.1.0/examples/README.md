# Weld Examples

Here we present a few end to end workloads using weldnumpy. Note that in all of
these examples, for smaller data sizes NumPy clearly outperforms weldnumpy, as
the overhead of setting up weld, and compilation costs, dominate the runtime.
But as the size increases, weld's advantages become clearer.
